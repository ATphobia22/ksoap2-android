== Developing

If you want to help on the actual codebase, here is what you need

=== Pre-requisites

* Apache Maven installed - (3.1.1 or higher as enforced during the build) 
* Alternatively use the mvnw wrapper scripts
* Optionally for better testing and debugging support any Java IDE
* Optionally git or svn to get the code from github, unless you download the source as zip

=== Getting the code

You can just get the code from github as usual from the site https://github.com/simpligility/ksoap2-android/

----
git clone git@github.com:simpligility/ksoap2-android.git
----
 

=== Building

The usual Maven invocations apply. A full build is done with

----
mvn clean install
----

or using the Maven wrapper

----
mvnw clean install
----

The documentation website can be built with

----
mvn clean site -N
----

with the resulting HTML found in +target/site/+.
